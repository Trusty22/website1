Learning Javascript 

This is project 1 of Tree's printing; I want to display them on a website to understand how js interacts with HTML/CSS.
My end goal is to be able to use my internship knowledge, combined with this practice, to make a good-looking website which is also functional.

After this understanding, I will move on to ReactJS to gain a complete understanding of front-end development.

With this, I will apply to jobs and have the basics covered before I start exploring a backend and how we work with DB's and use SQL and PHP.

This will all accumulate, finally, in learning the combination software ___
